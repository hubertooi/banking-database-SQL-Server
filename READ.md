# Banking Database project

A database I created with SQL Server for my Database class.

### What I included in this git

* The Banking database SQL code which includes the creation of tables, data insertion, and
data query.

* ERD and Physical ERD I created with Lucidchart.com to illustrate the Entities relationship.

* Project docx that includes the use cases and my relationship models I derived for my database.
